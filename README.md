# Coffeemaker Project
## Description
- Develop a program for a coffee machine to make 3 types of hot drinks 
  - Espresso
  - Latte
  - Cappuccino
- Have it be able to take in coin values and determine if the user has input enough money into the coin system
- It must also be able to check if there are enough resources to make each of the drinks and output a message stating whether the drink is made or if there is not enough of a certain resource available
